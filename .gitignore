#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/ror/.bundle

# Ignore all environment files (except templates).
/ror/.env*
!/ror/.env*.erb

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/ror/log/.keep
!/ror/tmp/*
!/ror/log/.keep
!/ror/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/ror/tmp/pids/*
!/ror/tmp/pids/
!/ror/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore storage (uploaded files in development and any SQLite databases).
/ror/storage/*
!/ror/storage/.keep
/ror/tmp/storage/*
!/ror/tmp/storage/
!/ror/tmp/storage/.keep

/ror/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
